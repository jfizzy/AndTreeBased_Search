Manager is the overall coordinator for the program

InputManager uses FileExaminer and InputWrapper to parse the input file
--> SearchData object

SearchManager works on a SearchData object
--> fills in the timetable

Constr works on a SearchData object
--> check() method for checking if hard constraints are met

--> getEval() method for evaluating soft constraints
